Congratulations! You have completed the Kubernetes the AWSome Way! workshop.
We hope you have enjoyed learning more about Kuberentes on AWS.

Please remember to clean up any resources spun up during this workshop!

== Workshop cleanup

=== Delete kubernetes cluster resources

In your Cloud9 IDE, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

   $ kops get cluster

Delete kubernetes cluster _(replace `example.cluster.k8s.local` with your specific cluster name)_

   $ kops delete cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Wait until all the resources are deleted by kops.

=== Delete Cloud9 Development Environment

Go to the AWS CloudFormation console, right-click the 'k8s-workshop' template and select "Delete Stack"

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop.
