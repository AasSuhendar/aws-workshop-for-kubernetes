This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a Kubernetes development environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let you write, run and debug containerized workloads with just a web browser.

=== Create Cloud9 Environment
==== Option 1: Cloud9 Console
1. Log into the Cloud9 Console by visiting https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create

2. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple, such as `kubernetes-developmet`.  Then click "Next Step".


3. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

4. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it presents.

5. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

6. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the "Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that your new AWS Cloud9 environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the IDE will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the rest of this workshop.

=== Setup Environment

Your Cloud9 environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to support working with Kubernetes.

==== Configure the AWS CLI

Your Cloud9 environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user.  **It is not recommended that you change this.** Instead, it is recommended that the logged in user's account is provided the permissions needed to make the required calls for the rest of this workshop.

In the event that you want do not want to use the currently logged in user for these credentials, there are a couple options:

1. Instance Profile: You can create an Instance Role with the proper permissions and add that role to the ec2 instance hosting your environment
2. Use the AWC Configure command or environmental variables to permanently store credentials for the AWS CLI.

For instructions on these two options, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Cloud9].

Regardless of your option above, this workshop is designed to be run from the Ireland region (`eu-central-1`).  As such, you will need to to ensure any calls made through the CLI specify the Ireland region and not the default region for your Cloud9 environment (which will likely be us-west-2 or us-east-1).  To do this, you can:

* Include the `--region=eu-central-1` option in any of the workshops requests.
* Temporarily override the CLI's default region using the following environmental variable: `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1`. Please note that this will only persist for the duration of your session.

==== Verify Docker Version

Docker is presinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

  docker --version

This will output the following or newer version:

  Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

==== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the Kubectl CLI:

    $ curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

  kubectl version

This should output something similar to the follow:

  Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"8", GitVersion:"v1.8.0", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

==== Clone the repo

The workshop repo has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

  $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the section of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.
