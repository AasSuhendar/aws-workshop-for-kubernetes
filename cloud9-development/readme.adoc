This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a Kubernetes development environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let you write, run and debug containerized workloads with just a web browser.

=== Create AWS Cloud9 Environment
==== Option 1: AWS Cloud9 Console
1. Log into the AWS Cloud9 Console by visiting https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create

2. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple, such as `kubernetes-developmet`.  Then click "Next Step".


3. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

4. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it presents.

5. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

6. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the "Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that your new AWS Cloud9 environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the IDE will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the rest of this workshop.

=== Setup Environment

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to support working with Kubernetes.

==== Configure the AWS CLI

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user.

.Please Note
*********************
It is not recommended that you change the default AWS CLI config in your AWS Cloud9 environment. Instead, it is recommended that you provide the logged in user's account the permissions needed to make the required for your project.  More information on this can be found by visiting: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Cloud9]
*********************

For the sake of this workshop, we are going to configure the AWS CLI on your AWS Cloud9 environment using the AWS Configure command.  For this, use the same credentials you created in the "Create admin user and group" section of the https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes/blob/master/prereqs.adoc[Prerequesites] page.

  $ aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID [None]: *****
  AWS Secret Access Key [None]: *****
  Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
  Default output format [None]:


==== Verify Docker Version

Docker is preinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

  docker --version

This will output the following or newer version:

  Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

==== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the Kubectl CLI:

    $ curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

  kubectl version

This should output something similar to the follow:

  Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"8", GitVersion:"v1.8.0", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

==== Clone the repo

The workshop repo has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

  $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the section of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.

=== Automated Deployment using CloudFormation

You can also use a CloudFormation template to create the Kubernetes Development Environment. These templates will create the Cloud9 IDE with IAM Role as well as the kops state store bucket.

To launch the template in your account, you will need to download one of the following:

* To use an existing Subnet, download link:templates/lab-ide-novpc.template[lab-ide-novpc.template]
* To use a new VPC/Subnet, download link:templates/lab-ide-vpc.template[lab-ide-vpc.template]

==== Option 1: Console

1. Log into the AWS CloudFormation Console by visiting https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home

2. Click on **Create Stack**.

3. Under **Choose a Template**, click to *Upload a template to Amazon S3* and upload the file you downloaded earlier.

4. Click **Next**.

5. Specify a `Stack Name` and optionally a `SubnetId`. Click **Next**.

6. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Next**.

7. Under **Capabilities**, acknowledge that CloudFormation will create IAM resources, and click **Create**.

8. Wait until the stack you just launched has a status of `CREATE_COMPLETE` (you may need to refresh), then check the box next to the new stack and select the **Outputs** tab. This will show the URL to the Cloud9 IDE (`LabIdeUrl`). Click the URL to go into your IDE.

9. Download the build script: link:scripts/lab-ide-build.sh[lab-ide-build.sh].

10. Copy the contents of the build script and paste into the *Terminal* window in the IDE (near the bottom).

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the section of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.

==== Option 2: CLI

Get a list of existing public subnets.

.Command
[source,bash]
----
aws ec2 describe-subnets --query 'Subnets[?MapPublicIpOnLaunch==`true`].SubnetId'
----

.Output
[source,output]
----
[
    "subnet-1234abcd",
    "subnet-5678ef12",
    ...
]
----

Launch the CloudFormation stack, substituting a SubnetId for `<SubnetId>`.

.Command
[source,bash]
----
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name "LabIDE" --template-body file://lab-ide-novpc.template --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameters ParameterKey=SubnetId,ParameterValue=<SubnetId>
----

If you are using the link:templates/lab-ide-vpc.template[lab-ide-vpc.template], launch the stack using:

.Command
[source,bash]
----
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name "LabIDE" --template-body file://lab-ide-vpc.template --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
----

Once launched, occasionally poll the status of the stack.

.Command
[source,bash]
----
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name LabIDE --query "Stacks[0].StackStatus" --output text
----

When this changes from `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` to `CREATE_COMPLETE`, get the URL of the Cloud9 IDE.

.Command
[source,bash]
----
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name LabIDE --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`LabIdeUrl`].OutputValue' --output text
----

.Output
[source,output]
----
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ide/<EnvironmentId>
----

Launch the IDE by copying the URL into your browser.

Download the build script: link:scripts/lab-ide-build.sh[lab-ide-build.sh].

Copy the contents of the build script and paste into the *Terminal* window in the IDE (near the bottom).

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the section of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.
